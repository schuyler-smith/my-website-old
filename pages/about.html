                I am currently a Ph.D. candidate, working towards a degree in  
                <a href="https://www.bcb.iastate.edu/" target="_blank" >Bioinformatics and Computation Biology</a> at 
                <a href="https://www.iastate.edu/" target="_blank" >Iowa State University</a> in Ames, Iowa. My current plan is to graduate this summer and begin a new adventure outside of the graduate student life..

                A member of the 
                <a href="http://germslab.org/" target="_blank" >GERMS lab</a>
                , in the department of 
                <a href="https://www.abe.iastate.edu/" target="_blank" >Agriculture and Biosystems Engineering</a>
                , our research focuses on environmental microbiomes and metagenomes; predominantly soil, but also water-systems, manure, plant-interactions, and even flower nectar.

                 My research focuses heavily on data analysis and building tools for reproducible research. I enjoy data exploration and answering questions through data, but I equally enjoy enabling other researchers to answer their own questions with useful tools. This is why I put together tools and packages such as the 
                 <a href="https://schuyler-smith.github.io/phylosmith/" target="_blank" >phylosmith</a>
                  package, along with others you may find on my GitHub.

                Outisde of research, I have also been fortunate to travel to various parts of the world. Several were on birding trips with my father, but also some for conferences, and others just for vacation. I am not a photography enthusiast, but I like to document the places I have been. The 
                <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/pages/photos">photos page</a>  
                I have here has been more of a fun task in learning HTML, and a place to put photos to show family, than anything else. If I did cool wet-lab projects then I could probably put some neat science pictures up.. but in my case, that's pretty much just my
