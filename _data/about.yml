bio: 'Currently a Ph.D. candidate, working to earn a degree in  <a href="https://www.bcb.iastate.edu/" target="_blank" >Bioinformatics and Computation Biology</a> from <a href="https://www.iastate.edu/" target="_blank" >Iowa State University</a> in Ames, Iowa. My expected graduation date is in the summer of 2021.
<br>
<br>
A member of the <a href="http://germslab.org/" target="_blank" >GERMS lab</a>, in the department of <a href="https://www.abe.iastate.edu/" target="_blank" >Agricultural and Biosystems Engineering</a>, our research focuses on environmental microbiomes and metagenomes; predominantly soil, but also water-systems, manure, plant-interactions, and even flower nectar.
<br>
<br>
My research focuses heavily on data analysis and building tools and pipelines for reproducible research. I enjoy data exploration and answering questions through data, but equally, I enjoy enabling other researchers to answer their own questions with useful tools. This was the motivation to put together various software packages such as the <a href="https://schuyler-smith.github.io/phylosmith/" target="_blank" >phylosmith</a> R-package, along with others you may find on my GitHub. This is also what inspired me to become an instructor for <a href="https://carpentries.org/" target="_blank" >the Carpentries</a>.
<br>
<br>
Throughout my gradute experiences I have worked on a wide variety of projects. During my M.S. research, I was a member of a maize breeding lab where I produced molecular characterizations of the Texas breeding stock compared to traditional Midwestern varieties, using SNP markers. After completing that work, I moved to a Ph.D. program where I developed a pipeline for identifying SNP markers in autotetraploid species from GBS data, and subsequently for GWAS. This was my first introduction to pipeline-develpment and high-throughput computing. After a year with this research, I knew my passion was not with plant genetics, but bioinformatics. I joined my current graduate program where I have been working with microbiomes.

personal: '
  In my recreational time, I enjoy ice cream, strategy games, sci-fi/fantasy books, coffee, and going to the gym. Pretty much in that order, though, unfortunately, the time spent on each is would not reflect that.'
# <br>
# <br>
#   I have also developed a passion for travel in the past few years. I have been fortunate to have opportunities to visit various parts of the world. Several trips have been for birding with my father, others for conferences, some just for the experience. I haven not found the passion for photography, but I do like to document the places I have been. As a practice in HTML, I have built a display of some of my <a href="https://schuyler-smith.github.io/photos">travels</a>.
